      <p>Hey everyone! My name is Zoe Papandreou and Iâ€™m from Far Hills, New Jersey.
         I attended the Pingry High School, where I played soccer and lacrosse.
         I have an older brother and a younger sister who I am very close with.
         At home, I am always spending time with my dog. His name is Oreo and he is a
         fluff ball of energy who only weighs 10 pounds, so he always needs my attention.
         I am more of a TV than movie person, so I would have to say some of my favorite shows are
         White Collar and Quantico. I also love watching documentaries, one of my favorites being Fyre
         as Billy McFarland actually went to my high school.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div style="text-align: center; font-family: courier; color: limegreen">
      <p>One of my biggest strengths would have to be my optimism. My friends and family would say
        that I am a very happy person who tries to approach all situations with a positive outlook and see the good in people.
         This positivity translates into my academics in the face of difficult tasks, to which I approach with a determined yet
          patient mindset. For weaknesses, I would say I get relatively nervous in new, unfamiliar situations. When I am faced with
          the unknown I lack confidence. I also hate making phone calls to strangers, even if it is just to order food.
      </p>
