# IPPFA20
A modified version of the IPPFA20 repository, used for deployment on Netlify

This is a modified version of the code used in https://github.com/er9fa/IPPFA20, significantly trimmed down and with all code stored in html files, but otherwise kept nearly identical to the original.
It uses no frameworks, instead providing a set of static html pages, meant to be displayed on Netlify.
