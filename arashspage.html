    <h1> Arash's Page </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 12px;"> Hey y’all! My name is Arash Azizi and I am from NOVA, specifically a little town called Clifton. When I am not stressing out about classes, I like to go to the gym, bake, draw, volunteer, and watch football (Fly Eagles Fly!). On the topic of baking, I love to bake cookies and brownies the most, so if anyone wants to have a socially distanced bake-off, just let me know! My favorite TV shows are Game of Thrones (before season 8) and Peaky Blinders, which I highly  recommend! As for my favorite movie, I would say my favorite would have to be the Lion King and my favorite movie series would be the Lord of the Rings trilogy. My guilty pleasures would have to be eating an unhealthy amount of chocolate and candy and watching the Bachelor/Bachelorette/any trashy reality TV show. When it comes to my strengths, I would have to say my biggest strength would be my positivity and optimism. I am always of the mindset that a smile can go a long way, whether it’s improving the mood of the people around me or even my own mood. And I am always on the glass half full side of life, even when things do be getting tough. Keeping a positive attitude has just always pushed me to make the most of life and all the experiences life has to offer. As for my weaknesses, I am easily distracted and have the tendency to overthink. I might be in the middle of doing homework then just decide that I might go work out then come back make dinner then forget that I had homework then get distracted by TikTok. It’s a whole struggle trust me.
