    <h1>Hongze's Page</h1>
    <h3 style="font-family:Impact">Hi!</h3>
    <p>My name is Hongze Chen, and I am from Fairfax, Virginia. Six years ago I would have been living in Chicago, Illinois; eight years ago, Toronto, Canada. I’ve been to all sorts of places in my life, and I can definitely say I don’t have a favorite--no matter where I go, there’s always something to admire and appreciate. My love of travel certainly hasn’t waned over the years, which makes this quarantine all the more frustrating. Aside from that, I enjoy STEM-related stuff, nature, karate, assembling and fixing things, the internet...a bit here and there. I’m certainly not the most social person you’ll ever meet, nor am I the most outspoken about my interests, but if you enjoy video games, memes, adding parts to your computers, or random subway trivia, I’m sure we’ll get along just fine. (The next time you get to ride the DC metro, pay attention to the platform lights. They flash differently at different locations.)
I would say my greatest strength is my meticulousness. I am an extremely detail-oriented person who greatly appreciates the connections/intricacies among concepts/tasks, so I am generally very careful with my work and strive for perfection. On the other hand, my meticulousness and perfectionism is also one of my greatest weaknesses, since combined with a lack of self-confidence and a huge internet addiction, it might take me some time to get things done. I’m working on it, though! All and all, I like to think I am an honest, persistent person who is dedicated towards helping my teammates, and I’m prepared to give it my all, no matter what we encounter.</p>
    <p style="font-family:georgia; color:blue"><strong>I look forward to working with everyone!</strong></p>
